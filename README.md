# PrimePutt Design Replication

This project is a front-end replication of the [PrimePutt](https://primeputt.com/products/golf) product page, focusing specifically on the layout and design **above the "As Seen On" section**. The goal was to closely match the original siteâ€™s visual structure, styling, and responsive behavior while ensuring a clean, modular, and reusable codebase. Content from the "As Seen On" section and below was intentionally excluded.
